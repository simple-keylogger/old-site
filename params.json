It is pretty simple, but I will expand:\r\n\r\n`klog_visible` is visible, and the window does not close when typing. Great for testing it out. `klog_invisible` makes the window of the logger disappear, and it also starts up hidden from view. Note that it is still visible in the task manager.\r\n\r\nBoth of these save the keystrokes to a .txt file when closed.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Mac\r\nThis is a little more complicated, as its Apple after all! Please note, it does not work for secure areas such as password inputs. I have not found a work around yet.\r\n\r\n#### Installation\r\nDownload the repo. It will install in `/usr/local/bin/keylogger`.\r\n\r\nInstall it:\r\n\r\n`$ git clone https://github.com/GiacomoLaw/Keylogger && cd keylogger\r\n$ make && make install`\r\n\r\nIt will log to `/var/log/keystroke.log`. This may require root access, but you can change that if you want. Set where you want it to log:\r\n\r\n`$ keylogger ~/logfile.txt\r\nLogging to: /var/log/keystroke.log`\r\n\r\nWant to make it start on system startup?\r\n\r\n`$ sudo make uninstall`\r\n\r\nThat will run it on startup.\r\n\r\n#### Uninstall\r\n`$ sudo make uninstall`\r\nWill uninstall the program, but not the logs.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Linux\r\n#### Installation\r\nYou'll need to install python-xlib if you don't have it.\r\n\r\n`sudo apt-get install python-xlib`\r\n\r\nCheck that you have git installed, and then run this.\r\n\r\n`git clone https://github.com/GiacomoLaw/Keylogger`\r\n\r\nThis will clone this entire repo. Find the linux folder, extract it, and open it. Rename the extracted folder to `linux-logger` Then run this:\r\n\r\n`giacomo@vostro:~$ cd linux-logger/`\r\n\r\nSet where you want the log to go **before** running this step.\r\n\r\n`giacomo@vostro:~/linux-logger$ python keylogger.py\r\n<class 'Xlib.protocol.request.QueryExtension'>\r\n<class 'Xlib.protocol.request.QueryExtension'>\r\nRECORD extension version 1.13`\r\n\r\nThe keylogger is now running! It will log your strokes to the file you specified. Stop it by hitting the grave key. Thats the one under escape on a standard keyboard.\r\n\r\nYou can make it run on startup:\r\n\r\n`python /home/giacomo/py-keylogger/keylogger.py`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@GiacomoLaw.
